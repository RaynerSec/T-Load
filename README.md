# T-Load
T-Load is back and better. You can now bind your payload in matter of seconds.  
The best part is that things are now automatic. A kind of automatic intelligence is added to the script to make it run like a breeze.  
Updates are all automatic unless a file has been broken, which rarely occurs unless done on a purpose.  
#### Please note that an active internet connection is must to embed the apps  with this script
