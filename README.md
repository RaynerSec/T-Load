# T-Load
T-Load is back and better.   
The best part is that things are now automatic. A kind of automatic intelligence is added to the script to make it run like a breeze.  
Updates are all automatic unless a file has been broken, which rarely occurs unless done on a purpose.  

## What is new?

### V 9
<li> Adding offline support for binding payload. </li>
<li><b> After running skstools the auto setup will run automatically, after which mafvenom -x option will be available in termux to bind payload</b></li>
<li><u><b> tload shortcut is now changed to skstool </b></u></li>

### V 8
<li> Now has a persistent port forwarding featue. </li>
